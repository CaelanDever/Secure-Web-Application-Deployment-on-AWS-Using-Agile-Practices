# Secure-Web-Application-Deployment-on-AWS-Using-Agile-Practices

This project aims to deploy a secure web application on AWS using agile methodologies like Scrum. The application will be hosted on EC2 instances within a VPC, secured with Zscaler VPN, and accessible via Route 53 DNS. The deployment process will be automated using AWS CodePipeline, and the infrastructure will include a load balancer with SSL, a transit gateway for network connectivity, and VPN authentication for secure access.
